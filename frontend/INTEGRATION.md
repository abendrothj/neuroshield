# NeuraShield Frontend Integration

This document outlines the integration progress and next steps for the NeuraShield frontend project.

## Implemented Features

### Backend Integration Layer
- ✅ Blockchain service API client with error handling and type safety
- ✅ Mock services for development and testing
- ✅ Service provider to switch between real and mock implementations
- ✅ Authentication token management in services

### Data Types and Models
- ✅ SecurityEvent interface with transaction hashes and blockchain status
- ✅ AIDetection type for machine learning predictions
- ✅ EventType enum for event categorization
- ✅ API response types with proper error handling

### UI Components
- ✅ Dashboard with tabbed interface for different data views
- ✅ BlockchainEvents component with filtering and sorting capabilities
- ✅ AIDetections component with confidence visualization
- ✅ Login form with mock authentication
- ✅ Protected routes with authentication checks
- ✅ Evidence component for displaying security event evidence
- ✅ IPFS file viewer with content preview

### Authentication System
- ✅ Context-based auth provider
- ✅ Login/logout functionality
- ✅ Token storage in localStorage
- ✅ Protected route wrapper

### IPFS Integration
- ✅ IPFS service for file retrieval and upload
- ✅ File preview component for IPFS content (supports JSON, text, images)
- ✅ File download functionality
- ✅ File upload with drag-and-drop interface
- ✅ Mock IPFS service for development and testing

## Next Steps

### Enhanced Analytics
- [ ] Add metrics dashboard with charts and statistics
- [ ] Create summary widgets for high-level metrics
- [ ] Implement real-time updates for incoming events

### User Management
- [ ] Connect authentication to real backend
- [ ] Add user management interface
- [ ] Implement role-based access control

### Additional IPFS Features
- [ ] Add folder upload capability
- [ ] Implement file pinning for permanent storage
- [ ] Add browsing functionality for previously uploaded files
- [ ] Create file sharing mechanism with access controls

## Testing

### Development Mode
1. Set environment variables in `.env.development`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_API=true
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY=https://ipfs.io/ipfs/
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Login with mock credentials:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: password

### Testing IPFS Integration
1. Navigate to the IPFS Storage tab in the dashboard.
2. Upload a file using the file uploader component.
3. The mock service will generate a simulated IPFS hash.
4. View the file details by clicking on it in the evidence list.
5. Try uploading different file types (JSON, images, text) to test preview functionality.

### Production Integration
1. Update `.env.production` with the actual API endpoints:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_API=false
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_API_URL=https://api.neurashield.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY=https://ipfs.neurashield.com/ipfs/
   ```
2. Build and start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
3. Verify integration with the backend using the Network tab in browser dev tools.
